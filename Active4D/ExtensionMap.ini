/*
	Active4D extension mappings
	
	This file provides mappings from filename extensions and types to MIME types.
	In addition, it determines which static content Active4D is willing to serve,
	because if a file is requested whose extension or type is not listed here,
	it will not be served.
	
	The format of each entry is:
	
		extension<WS>MIME type<EOL>
	
	<WS>              - One or more spaces or tabs
	extension         - File extension for the given MIME type, including the leading dot.
	                    Including the dot, the maximum size is 7 characters. Case doesn't matter.
	MIME type         - A standard MIME type, e.g. "image/gif". It should be all lowercase.
	<EOL>             - Line ending for any platform
	
	If you need to serve static content with an extension other than one that appears
	in this file, you must add an entry for it.
