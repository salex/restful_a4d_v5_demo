	REALMS
	------
	This file defines the http authentication realms for your site. Authentication realms
	are used to provide password-protected access to all or part of a site. Every time a request
	is made, Active4D matches the full URL against the realms specified in this file. If there
	is a match, the realm is set accordingly and the On Authenticate event handler in the
	Active4D library is called.
	
	Each entry in this file consists of two tab-delimited fields as follows:
	
		Realm		Match string
	
	There may be any number of tabs between fields. The realm should consist of ASCII characters,
	and spaces in a realm name are converted to underscores. Both the realm name and match string
	are limited to 255 characters.
	
	The entries are searched in order, so only the first match is used. Matching is 
	case-insensitive and the entire match string must match a portion of the URL. An invalid or missing realm or match string will result in that entry being ignored. The final entry 
	should be terminated with a carriage return.
	
	Matching is performed as follows:
	
	- If the match string begins with ?, it is matched against the query string.
	  If any portion of the query string matches, the associated realm is set, otherwise
	  no realm is set.
	
	- If any portion of the hostname matches the entire match string, the associated realm
	  is set.
	  
	- Otherwise if any portion of the URL path matches the entire match string, the associated
	  realm is set, otherwise no realm is set.
	
	
	EXAMPLES

	mac.home.com		mac.home.com		// Match a hostname
	test				/test/				// Match a directory
	admin				?fuseaction=admin.	// Match a portion of the query string
