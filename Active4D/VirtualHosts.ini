	VIRTUAL HOSTS
	-------------
	Virtual hosts allow you to host more than one web site on a single machine and a single
	instance of 4D. Each virtual host can be mapped to a different web root and/or
	different default page.
	
	There are three criteria you can use to determine the virtual host: IP address, hostname[:port],
	and the preferred language set by the user in the browser. The entries in this file
	specify how to map those criteria to a web root and/or default page.
	
	The format consists of five tab-delimited fields as follows:
	
	IP Address		Hostname	Language	Root|Host	Default
	
	There may be any number of tabs between fields. Line and block comments may be used.
	You may use a value of * in the IP Address, Hostname and Language fields to ignore that 
	field when matching. Using * in the Root|Host or Default fields indicates that the global values 
	set in Active4D.ini should be used. All fields are limited to 255 characters in length.
	
	The entries are searched in order, so they should progress from most specific
	to the least specific. Hostname matching is case-insensitive and Language matching is
	case-sensitive. Both the IP Address and Hostname fields accept standard 4D wildcard
	characters to allow partial matches. Otherwise the entire field must match. An invalid or 
	missing value will result in that entry being ignored.
	
	The Hostname field must include the port if the host is on a port other than 80.
	
	The Root|Host field may contain two values, separated by "|" (vertical bar). If this field does 
	not contain "|", the entire contents of the field is used to specify the web root. If the field 
	contains "|", the portion to the left of the "|" specifies the web root, and the portion to the 
	right of the "|" specifies the virtual host name.
	
	The web root portion should be a URL-style (Unix) path. If it is relative (not beginning with "/")
	it is relative to the default directory, which is the database directory under
	Standalone/Server, or the application directory under Client. You may use any of the
	path tokens (such as <4d volume>) that are valid for the root option in Active4D.ini.
	
	The virtual host name portion can be any text (including spaces). The specified name is
	available through the "*virtual host" item in the "request info" collection.
	
	The Default field specifies the filename of the page that should be used as the default page
	for the given virtual host.
	
	The final entry in the table should be terminated with a line ending.
	
	If a match is made with the IP Address, Hostname, and Language fields, the Root|Host and Default
	fields are used to set the web root, virtual host, and default page, overriding whatever value 
	was used for the "root" and "default page" options in Active4D.ini.
